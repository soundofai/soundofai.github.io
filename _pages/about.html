      	<center><h3> What is the Sound of AI curriculum? </h3></center>
      	<p> The goal of this curriculum is to engage students with interactive lessons and projects, and to have them think critically about signal processing, AI, and creative human-AI music collaboration. Throughout this course, students will have open-ended discussions on questions such as:
      		<ul>
      			<li>- How do we compare and contrast human hearing and machine hearing?</li>
      			<li>- How do the signal properties of music impact what we hear?</li>
      			<li>- How can we interface with artificial intelligence to creative collaborative music projects?</li>
      			<li>- What kind of projects can you create with interactive music-generating AI?</li>
      		</ul>
      	</p>
      	<p>These questions will allow students to gain a deeper understanding of music and its properties, and reflect on their own abilities to create music with interactive AI.</p>

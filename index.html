            <p> The goal of this curriculum is to engage students with interactive lessons and projects, and to have them think critically about signal processing, AI, and creative human-AI music collaboration. Throughout this course, students will have open-ended discussions on questions such as:
                <ol>
                    <li>Gain a deeper understanding of human and machine audition, and the similarities and differences between them.</li>
                    <li>Understand the signal properties that make music sound the way it does, and create music by modifying these properties.</li>
                    <li>Interact with AI agents to build creative music generation projects.</li>
                  </ol>
            </p>
